Objective:
Optimize road construction costs using Prim's Algorithm to compute the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST), ensuring all cities are connected at minimal cost.

Key Features:
Graph Representation: Uses an adjacency matrix.
Algorithm: Implements Prim’s Algorithm for cost-efficient road networks.
User Input & Validation: Ensures correct city indices and positive road costs.
Output: Displays optimized road connections and total minimum cost.
Scalability: Supports future enhancements like GUI, GIS integration, and other algorithms.

Implementation:
Language: Java
Data Structure: Adjacency Matrix
Complexity: O(V²)
Interface: Console-based (Future GUI upgrade)
Error Handling: Prevents invalid inputs

Results:
Successfully calculates the MST for given cities.
Ensures an optimized and cost-effective road network.

Conclusion:
This project minimizes construction costs while ensuring connectivity. Future upgrades can include graphical visualization and real-world data integration.
